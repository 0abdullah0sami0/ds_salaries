# Analyzing a dataset of Data Scientists Salaries

In this project I used R language and Rmarkdown to create a data analysis report analyzing data science job salaries. The data used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) and it includes over 600 observations about data science job salaries and other properties. I performed an exploratory data analysis where I investigated using visualizations the distribution of job salaries in relation to other job properties.
